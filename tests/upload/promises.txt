Promise - 
 # A Promise in JavaScript is an object representing future result.
 
 # Basically, in promise, you commit to do some task. That task has two 
   results - either resolved or failed.
 
 # They are very useful in scenarios when a response is going to take
   a long time, for e.g downloading an image from server, where you want 
   to perform an operation when it is successfully downloaded.
   So, even if it fails, you can retry it or give user an error message.
 

  
   Syntax - 
   
   let prom = new Promise()  // a promise object which has one parameter, an anonymous (fat arrow) function
                             // which takes two variables, resolve and reject.
                             
    let prom = new Promise((resolve,reject) => {
       let a = 1 + 1;
       if(a == 2)
       {
         resolve("Success");
       }
       else
       {
         reject("Failed");
       }
    })
    
    //then() method - this method is only going to be called when the promise 
                      resolves successfully.
                      
    //catch() method - this method is only going to be called when the promise
                       is rejected.
    prom.then((message) => {
      console.log("This is the then " + message);
    }).catch((message) => {
      console.log("This is the catch " + message);
    }
