✅ What Are Allure Reports? (Simple Definition)

Allure Report is a beautiful, interactive HTML report for test results.
It shows:

✔ Steps
✔ Screenshots
✔ Logs
✔ Test results (passed/failed/skipped)
✔ Retries
✔ Each test’s data (useful for data-driven testing!)

It's much more visual than Playwright’s default HTML report.

✅ Can You Use Allure Reports with Playwright Using Notepad++ + CMD?

YES.
You don’t need VS Code. All steps work perfectly with Notepad++ and Command Prompt.

⭐ How to Add Allure Reports to Playwright (Step-by-Step for Your System)

Follow these EXACT steps.

STEP 1 — Install Allure CLI (Windows)
Option 1: Install via Scoop (recommended)

If you don’t have Scoop, install it:

Open CMD (as normal user):

powershell -command "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser"


Then:

powershell -command "iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex"


Now install Allure:

scoop install allure


Done ✔

STEP 2 — Install the Allure Reporter for Playwright

Go to your Playwright project folder:

cd E:\JavaScript\playwright


Run:

npm install -D allure-playwright
npm install -D @playwright/test

STEP 3 — Enable Allure Reporter in playwright.config.js

Open your playwright.config.js and add this inside reporter: section:

reporter: [
  ['allure-playwright'],
  ['html']
],


Your reporter block should look like:

reporter: [
  ['allure-playwright'],
  ['html']
],

STEP 4 — Run Tests and Generate Allure Results

Run your tests from CMD:

npx playwright test


This will generate a folder:

allure-results

STEP 5 — Generate HTML Allure Report

Run:

allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report


Then open the report:

allure open allure-report


This opens a beautiful dashboard in your default browser.

🎉 That’s It! You Now Have Allure Reports Working With Playwright

You can repeat these two commands whenever needed:

Run tests
npx playwright test

Generate & open report
allure generate allure-results --clean -o allure-report
allure open allure-report

⭐ Extra Tips (Useful for Data-Driven Tests)

If you want each data-driven test to show custom Allure labels:

import { test } from '@playwright/test';
import { allure } from 'allure-playwright';

test('Login', async ({ page }) => {
  allure.label('feature', 'LoginModule');
  allure.label('severity', 'critical');
});


(Not required, but helps organize reports.)
