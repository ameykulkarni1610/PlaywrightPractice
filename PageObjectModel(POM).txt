# Page Object Model (POM) is a generic design pattern used in testing 
  frameworks to achieve maintainablity and reusability.
  
# We can use POM with any testing framework such as playwright, selenium,
  cypress, webdriver io,etc.
  
# We use this pattern to automate design application.
  we try to replicate pages in our programming.
  pages include login page, register page, home page, payment page,etc.
  
# For every page, we create a dedicated class. For e.g.
  login page class for login page, register class for register,etc. 
  
# In terms of programming we create classes which contain locators
  and also methods which performs on locators.
  
# Once all those pages are ready, we design a script which contain
  test cases.
  
# Test cases will execute complete flow. For e.g. login page
  then register, then home page, and so on.
  
# You can create methods and access them depends on what kind of
 operations you want to perform.
 
 Why we need POM?

# Reusability - 
  Once you create any method, all other related test cases or scripts can 
  use it.You can write the code once and use it in different tests.
  
# Maintenanace -
  Clean separation between test code and page specific code, becomes 
  very easy to maintain code and reduce duplication.
